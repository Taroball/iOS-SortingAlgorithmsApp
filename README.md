### Do you want to contribute? Check the backlog

#### // TODO:
- [ ] New algorithms;
- [ ] Control animation speed;
- [ ] Add algorithm details about the selected algorithm;
- [ ] Improve code coverage (unit tests);
- [ ] More features to the backlog :)

### Adding a new algorithm

Create a class implemeting the protocol ```Algorithm```. Following the example for the class ```InsertionSort```, you'd need to set the title of your algorithm, the image (pick a nice logo representing your algorithm:)) and description. In the method ```GenerateSwaps```, add the necessary logic to generate all cell swaps which would be necessary.

```Swift 
final class InsertionSort: Algorithm {
    
    final var title: String = "Insertion Sort"
    final var image: String = "ic_insertion"
    final var description: String = "Insertion Sort Description"
    
    final func generateSwaps(from list: [Int]) -> [(x0: Int, x1: Int)] {
        if list.count == 1 { return [] }
        
        var array = list
        var swaps = [(x0: Int, x1: Int)]()
        
        // APPEND ALL GENERATED SWAPS TO IT'S ARRAY
        
        return swaps
    }
}
```

### Update the data source with your new algorithm

```Swift
class AlgorithmsListPresenter {
    
    private weak var view: AlgorithmsListView?
    private let router: AlgorithmsListRoutering
    
    private let dataSource: [Algorithm] = [
        BubbleSort(),
        InsertionSort(),
        SelectionSort()
    ]
 ...
}   
```
